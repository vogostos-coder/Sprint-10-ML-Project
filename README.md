# Sprint-10-ML-Project

## Context
Machine Learning regression project focused on comparing different models and evaluating their performance from a practical, decision-oriented perspective.

## Objective
Train and evaluate regression models to select the most appropriate option based on objective metrics and generalization capability.

## Models Evaluated
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest Regressor  

## Evaluation Metric
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## Process
- Dataset split into training, validation, and test sets  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Model performance comparison  
- Final evaluation on the test set  
- Sanity check to validate model consistency  

## Final Model
- Random Forest Regressor

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of model comparison, validation, and prioritizing stability and generalization over algorithm complexity. The main value lies in the analytical process and informed decision-making rather than the final metric alone.
